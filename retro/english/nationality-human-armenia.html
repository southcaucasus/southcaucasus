<strong>THE «NATIONALITY - HUMAN»</strong> - will screen recent documentary films from different parts of the world in various cities and regions of the South Caucasus. Believing that the world is one and the language of cinema knows no borders, we think viewers in the Caucasus will be able to see themselves in the fates of people from other parts of the world, in their struggles for peace and justice. This is the first festival of its kind in the South Caucasus !
<br /><br />
 <strong>THE «NATIONALITY - HUMAN»</strong> - is non-competitive film festival. In our jury there are young film-makers, film critics and NGO activists from the South Caucasus, Germany and the Czech Republic. They have selected six recent documentaries of international reputation (from Israel, former Yugoslavia, France and the United States). Of these they composed a three-day programme.
<br /><br />
<strong>THE «NATIONALITY - HUMAN»</strong> - is a festival “on wheels” – we will come to you with our mobile-cinema, bringing all the technical equipment needed for screening! (If we are unable to reach you by our cinemabus, we will find different means of transportation.)

 <strong>FESTIVAL</strong> was given birth to by a few miraculous people and those who believed them and stood by them.
<br /><br />
<strong>FESTIVAL</strong> became a beginning of a path – a rocky and a difficult one, but in the same time a right and a humane one.
<br /><br />
<strong>FESTIVAL</strong> became a symbol of South Caucasus relativity against all conflicts.
<br /><br />
<strong>FESTIVAL</strong> united two important ideas: Peace and Human Rights.
<br /><br />
<strong>WE</strong> remain un-free in South Caucasus, because we don’t tie peace and freedom between one another, and among that, peace and freedom are inseparable. Only with respect to individual rights and freedoms it’s possible to achieve peace in Caucasus.
<br /><br />
<strong>WE </strong> are a unified region, and we are supposed to exchange with our concerns, pain, grief, speak, try to tell each other about what we feel, about what we understood and what we didn’t. Because conflicts start when we stop talking to each other. They start from proud silence filled with the belief that we know more than our neighbors.
<br /><br />
<strong>A CITIZEN </strong> must become the active face of the festival. During the process of festival discussions, the demand in the peace, the demand which is conserved within each of our families, will be brought out into an open square and will be voiced on that square through an outsider citizen, a citizen which is the target of a conflict. We must form our social request for peace, and turn government and political officials into the performers of that order.
<br /><br />
<strong>HERE</strong> our conversation has begun and let it continue.

<i>Any type of war is a provocation that’s always brought on by skinheads of different suites. It’s a known fact that during war it’s not the entire nation that fights. War cultivates all existing problems and with every war these contradictions deepen more and more.

<i>When I was watching how all children even Jewish kids were doing the Muslim praying ritual during the celebration of Ramadan, I asked my friend if she could imagine her child performing a Muslim ritual. It’s very difficult to imagine. Even though I myself am atheist there is no real reason for me to be worried… but at some point I did not feel like myself, I felt how bad what they were doing was. </i>
