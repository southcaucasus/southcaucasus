   <strong>David  Darchiashvili: </strong>I would like to greet the participants of this event, which I only heard  about recently about a month ago. The initiative is very interesting and I hope  this endeavour will turn into one of the influential, if not the leading,  platform for dialogue - a very complicated process of trust-building between  the nations of the South Caucasus and the Caucasus as a whole. The most  important thing is the willingness and good will. Moreover, I hope that this  model of expertise and discussion will be further applied. I believe this  platform, which is not narrow anymore, will enlarge and similar meetings will be frequent.<br><br>
 		  	
 Although my participation at the hearing is a personal choice and I do  not officially represent the Parliament of Georgia, I would like to say a word  about the influence of initiatives by public organizations on the political  process. Without such public initiatives it would have been impossible to solve  conflict yesterday, nor would it be possible today and tomorrow. On the other  hand, we should not overrate the potential of grassroots diplomacy as well. We  might have illusions and later become disappointed if results are not  forthcoming immediately, with those intricate, long-lasting deep problems and  conflicts existing in the South Caucasus, and the Caucasus as a whole, not  resolved as soon as we expect. For now, in the foreseeable future, the world  system is based on relations among states as sovereign structures, and the  world, according to international relations experts, remains anarchic which  means an absence of unified management with each state a master unto itself. Of  course, this is not an exhaustive evaluation since there is international law  and international organizations which pay more attention to civil initiatives.  Nevertheless, we have to admit there are governments whose perceptions and  decisions are final and whose interests usually, as in this particular case,  collide with each other. As a rule, conflicts remain as is and their resolution  drags on.<br>
  <br>
  If we directly deal with the subject brought up for  today's discussion we should consider it in a wider perspective and context.  Indeed, comparing and calculating which of the existing conflicts is tougher is  not a grateful thing. Nevertheless, it may be supposed that the main complexity  in the problem of Tskhinvali region and Abkhazia is the presence of an  extra-regional power since these territories are considered not only by us, but  by international community as well, to be occupied by the country which has a  hand in regional matters and at the same time is a powerful multi-regional  player with huge potential. This  certainly complicates the situation and the process of resolving the problems.  On the other hand, the diagnosis here is clearer; it is easy to find the  reasons and the truth: the parties adequately and objectively evaluate their  interests. As fast as the Karabakh problem is concerned, I think experts will  also support the opinion that there is a direct and indirect presence of that  multi-regional player. But the problem  of Karabakh conflict is not only this. I  also think this conflict has its own dynamics. Here antagonisms between the  countries, Armenia and Azerbaijan, intertwine more. That is, if there was not  that power, which was very obviously interested at that time in fuelling the  conflict (that power is doing the same too, but anyway, you judge), there would  still be firmer ground for conflict which makes it hard to solve.
  <br>
  <br>
  I will make it clear that I do not see any special  instruments at the disposal of Georgia in order to effectively tackle the task  of mediation in the resolution of this conflict. Whether the existing  extra-regional instrument has a 100 percent effect on the situation or not, it  will be discussed by the speakers, but the real configuration reminded me of  itself a few days ago at the meeting of the three presidents in the suburbs of  Sochi. Regardless of who's and to what benefit this instrument is used, it is  clear those opportunities of Georgia, gently speaking, are limited. However, we  should not say that they are limited completely. There are contacts, personal  contacts on all levels, including at the highest state level. You cannot make  wonders with only that, but you should not forget about it either. <br>
    <br>
    The venue we gather at today may not seem so  comfortable. Because usually you and I, who in past times dealt with the  arrangement of unofficial meetings and efforts to build trust between the  conflicting parties, were accustomed to being in a calm, tranquil and  comfortable environment. The participants should have access to all equipped premises,  with various gadgets, a fireplace burning somewhere in the corner etc. But this  is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that if there is  the will there is always an opportunity to meet anywhere in any conditions. But this venue, as I heard from Georgi, is a  special, symbolic place. It is close to the borders of our neighbouring  countries Armenia and Azerbaijan, and overall the bordering position of this  location already inclines people to discuss vital problems. If all those people  of good will who want to contribute to the resolution of conflict will feel  that the symbolism and aura of this very place fosters dialogue, guides them to  search for solutions - genuine searches for unconventional solutions to our  problems - then most likely the infrastructure of this place will develop too  and Tekali will become much more convenient for meetings and joint work.<br>
    <br>
    We cannot say that today public organizations have a decisive influence  on political decisions, but they have their own advantages and a potential that  political structures do not. You, public organizations, have an opportunity to  initiate ideas and approaches, which may seem idyllic, illusionary and  unrealisable today. But I think that something which may appear as a miracle  and out of reality and logic in politics, just like in science, contributes to  the progress. Therefore, I hope that today's meeting and its continuation will  make for this progress, the generation of such initiatives, which eventually  will be accepted by a wider audience and in this case will have an impact on  politicians. Sometimes it is said that conflicts are invented by politicians  but I do not quite agree with that. You  may think this is subjective because I also represent political circles, but I  genuinely want to say: no, it is more often that politicians do not want  conflicts and that their heads hurt from conflicts - this is too difficult.  Simply there are stereotypes in societies, there are also certain moods that  cannot be forgotten or ignored especially when we speak about countries where  political structures depend on choices. That is, allowing for some  exaggeration, if you manage to change the mood of society, politicians will  find a way for additional innovations to interact between each other. Thanks a  lot.<br>

 <strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>When Mr. Georgi suggested that I be a speaker at this hearing I thought  that this matter is ambiguous and there can be different approaches to it.  There are arguments for and against Georgia's capability of playing an  effective role as mediator in the resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict.  I am convinced that Mr. Mamuka will also admit the existence of various  arguments asserting or excluding this thesis. In this particular case, I will  focus on the arguments "for" and try to explain my opinion: the  reason why I think this idea is worth attention and that it can have a positive  impact.<br><br>
 
 Since the beginning of the 90s there have emerged four  ethno-political conflicts in the post-soviet space: Abkhaz, Nagorno Karabakh,  South Ossetian and Transnistrian. There were other conflict situations as well,  but now they are exhausted, outdated and not mentioned at all. The fact that  three of the conflicts are located in such a small territory as the South  Caucasus says something. It turned out that it is very difficult to find a  political solution, even a theoretical one, which can enliven the negotiation  process and lead to the signing of the relevant treaties. The August war of  2008 complicated this situation even more and took the conflicts out of the  frozen category. Georgia suffered a huge blow. But I want to say that the fact  Georgia took the blow is evidence of the reality that based on its own negative  experience Georgia may suggest something useful in the resolution of the  Nagorno Karabakh conflict.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would also say that we do not have experience of inter-regional mediation in the resolution of conflicts.  That is, so far we have been on good terms with our small countries and  superpowers, large international organizations who, so to say, explain to us  how we should solve our problems. We are always in the position of a listener,  when in reality we have enough experience and internal understanding of the  problem, which is never external, in order to suggest a solution to the problem  ourselves.<br>
<br>
The following arguments stand in favour of Georgia offering its mediation:<br>
<br>
- direct neighborhood of all three countries  in the historical region of the Caucasus;<br>
<br>
- in general, the positive impact of cultural  interaction among the three nations in the pre-conflict period;<br>
<br>
- stable and balanced relations of Georgia with  Azerbaijan and Armenia. As for Armenia, relations are also close to stable and  balanced, but it has to be said that there are problems which can arise, say,  with the transit of goods, some local problems in Javakheti where certain  Armenian groups and powers are also involved, but it cannot be considered an  international problem. There is an inter-state problem between Armenia and  Azerbaijan. Georgia has no inter-state problem with Azerbaijan and Armenia, nor  is there any territorial dispute with these countries. This is also a positive  factor in this subject-matter;
<br>
<br>
- firsthand knowledge and internal experience in  Georgia about and with the situation of long drawn out ethno-political conflict  and experience of a humanitarian crisis. Humanitarian crisis in this  particular case means a large number of refugees and IDPs as a result  of armed conflict.<br>
<br>
Besides,
<br>
<br>
- Inability of international organizations -  particularly the UN and the OSCE - in all three South  Caucasus conflicts to find mechanisms for peace-enforcement or to  work out mutually acceptable conditions for the parties to sign a peace treaty.  For how long has the Minsk group existed, we already see the result of its  work. Hence, the next argument: the long drawn out and fruitless attempts by  the OSCE Minsk group and international organizations to revive the  Karabakh negotiation process and here we should note the mistrust of  Azerbaijanis towards Russia as a mediator. That is, Azerbaijan is unlikely to  invite Russia to mediate in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict because Russia is  known to support the Armenian side although the Armenian side is acting with  caution in this regard. Who can be a mediator then? This question has already  been raised and Georgia has its chances. <br>
<br>
- Awareness of Georgian society (at  least in relation to Abkhazia) of the inevitability  of confidence building measures with assigned regions  as precondition for peace talks. What do I mean here? I mean that  Georgia has an experience of including assigned regions in negotiations on a  public level. <br>
<br>
I personally do not agree with following assumption: the official  political position of Georgia imply that after the August crisis of 2008 we do  not have a conflict with Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but we have a conflict  with Russia and that Abkhazian and South Ossetian problems are part of the  problem with Russia. I think that we do have problem with Abkhazians and  South-Ossetians and it is necessary to sit with them over the negotiation table  as a result of confidence-building measures and using all official and  unofficial resources. We have to develop relations with them, define the nature  of our problems and find ways to solve them. That is, not denying the fact that  the our main problem is with Russia, I think there are also Abkhazian and South  Ossetian sides in the conflict. It is completely ineffective and unreal to  exclude them from involvement in negotiations. Hence I support this same point  of view in relation to Karabakh. Just like us, Georgians and Abkhazians,  Georgians and South Ossetians can talk to each other on the level of grassroots  diplomacy, I think that even if it does not happen officially, then on the  level of grassroots diplomacy Nagorno Karabakh should be included in dialogue.  I know that the more it is considered on an official level the more my  Azerbaijani friends are against it. They say it should not be done because of  their own various considerations. I respect their opinion. At the same time I  think it is a dead-end situation, when Nagorno Karabakh is not considered and  does not participate in negotiations. Therefore, my personal opinion is that  Azerbaijan might consider involvement of NK as a party to negotiations if  issues, such as achieving mutual understanding and certain compromise in  crucial matters that present a stumbling block between Armenia and Azerbaijan,  namely compromising over occupied lands, territories around NK in the framework  of gradual return of these lands, will be solved. There can be various options.  My role, as an expert in conflicts, is to not miss out any of the options that  can potentially change this frozen situation. This is in no way a precondition  for Georgia to participate as a mediator in the process. Absolutely not. Simply  I think that these issues could somehow enliven and multiply the number of  possible approaches which will be considered in case this idea is accepted. <br>
<br>
- Dominant view in Georgian  society that it would be possible to talk and agree with Abkhazians and  Ossetians if not for Russia. It is certainly a very naive position which  forgets that isolation between Georgians and Abkhazians and South Ossetians  reached the point when it is very difficult and takes a long time to find a way  out of this situation even if assuming that Russia would compromise at all and  help restore the union. The trust should be restored by nations - Georgians and  Abkhazians, Georgians and South Ossetians. But the fact that there is such an  opinion in Georgian society is already positive. It is a myth and na&iuml;ve belief  in the nations who have been living together for a long time, sharing a lot in  common, practicing mixed marriages, having friendly relations. It is a naive  belief that all of these can be made use of in order to reconcile despite the  position of the superpowers. This opinion does exist. 
<br>
<br>
I think that there are complications which mean that the idea of  Georgian mediation will be accepted more positively in Azerbaijan no matter the  sceptical attitude. Why? Because in this case Armenia takes Russia's position  into consideration more. And the fact that Azerbaijan has closer relations with  Georgia will be treated as a discouraging factor in Yerevan. Despite that, with  a proper structure of diplomatic efforts, Baku and Yerevan can create an  environment  where Georgia can play a  positive role in the mediation of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. And of course,  the personality of a leader, who will be engaged in this will matter here. I  would say this does not look imminent this and next year. If there will be a  change in leadership, it can play a positive role in this question.<br>
<br>
Considering all mentioned and other factors we may conclude that overall  mediation of Georgia in the resolution process of Nagorno Karabakh problem  might play a positive role. Thanks for your attention and I will gladly answer  your questions.

<i>Chairman  of the panel announces the session of questions and answers.<br>
<br>
</i><strong>Niyazi  Mehti, member of the panel: </strong>At the beginning of his speech a respectful deputy of  parliament was speaking about instruments. For me, this word is associated with "pressure". I am interested in the opinion of the speaker: Is there  any necessity in having instruments in order to be a mediator?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> No. Coercion in this issue will not bring anything good. In my opinion,  resolution of South Caucasus conflicts lies in the integration of South  Caucasus societies and countries. We have to understand that there are many  dangers in the Caucasus and this is why we have to secure ourselves, make this  region stronger. Whatever the problems, we have to search for the ways to build  a collective security system and regional supranational structures which could  unify the decision-making process in the South Caucasus. We have to think about  it. It looks a bit unreal given the relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan,  but there will come a time when other perils endangering the region might  encourage heads of states in the South Caucasus to think about the idea of  establishing supranational structures and a collective security system. Russia  certainly can get in the way because it is not interested in a united and  strong Caucasus. Russia wants to keep its own instruments of influence  here. At the same time, if there is a  consolidated position in the South Caucasus it will have an impact on expelled  people and they will get to see their own defence system within a collective  security system. For example, Abkhazians have nothing against becoming part of  a Caucasus confederation. But they are against being one with Georgia, being a  part of Georgia. Why? They are afraid of it. They have a fear of  becoming a part of Georgian country. If they will be led by, say, not a  Georgian government, but a confederative system of government in the South  Caucasus they will feel more secure. This can be one of the ways to solve the  problem. Creating something similar to the EU in the South Caucasus - open  borders, free economic zone etc- looks like fiction. But theoretically (I have  a degree in maths and view this as an abstract opportunity) - why not consider  this? If combining some conditions, it can become a reality. <br>
<br>
<strong>Emil  Adelkhanov, member of the panel: </strong>From what you say, the main rival to Georgia in the  mediation can be Russia... Would not another country other than Georgia and  Russia be more favourable in this situation?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> Thanks for the question, Emil. I will explain my position. Not only  Russia and Georgia, of course. There is also a long history of mediation by the  Minsk group and it proved to be unsuccessful. We can already make a conclusion.  There exists very few case scenarios which would mean the process will liven  and strengthen to the extent that Azerbaijan can rely on the Minsk group as on  a mediator in the resolution of the conflict. The Minsk group is leaving and it is necessary to think about new  opportunities. This is what I would like to stress.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ali  Babaev, union "Georgia - my home country": </strong>Batono Giorgi, do you not  think that the mediation of Georgia is overdue, that momentum is lost? I think  neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Iran should take a role as mediator  along with Georgia. And secondly: what role can societies in Armenia and  Azerbaijan play when for 25 years of conflict they did not change the  situation?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>Of course, I understand the level of feasibility in what we are talking  about. It is slim. At the same time I see that all other potential mediators of  this region will meet the needs of only one side. But international law  requires inviting both sides to the conflict - at an official level. And that  is why I can say that the fact we have been coming back to the idea of the  united Caucasus for 20 years says it all in favour of the idea of Georgia's  mediation. Caucasus home, Common Caucasus, the idea of a Caucasus union etc.  follows us now and then. It means something already.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galina  Petriashvili, Association of journalist "Gender Media Caucasus": </strong>What  is the background of Georgia in the resolution of conflicts?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> Of course, ineffective policy towards its own conflicts is a very  serious argument against Georgia. If we do not solve our conflicts, if we  cannot settle the mess in our own home, what can we offer to others? On the  other hand, as a result of many ineffective and mistaken actions we have made  with regards to our own problems, we have gained some experience of what not to  do. Now, when I see how the situation over Nagorno Karabakh escalates between  Armenia and Azerbaijan, I understand that the war may be real and if that  happens it will be too late. Until then, we have to make use of every  opportunity. And I have talked about one such opportunity.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galina  Petriashvili: </strong>Have we done something for Armenia and Azerbaijan in this regard?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>There have some diplomatic conditions. Various platforms with the  participation of Georgian representatives at international forums. I cannot say  anything about effective measures. Georgia was not single and separate in this  regard. Or rather, the presence of Georgia in similar platforms was modest.<br>
<br><strong>Sabina  Kalugova, NGO "Dove", Marneuli: </strong>Do not you think that a  country-mediator must have a certain influence not only in the Caucasus but  also in the world? In this issue influence and power is necessary so that  others would listen and want to listen to you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> Thank you for the question. It will help me to make my position clear.  When I was talking about the mediation of Georgia I did not mean on its own  initiative or personal position but a position agreed with the EU, USA and all  other international organizations such as&nbsp;  the UN, and OSCE. I think Georgia should have the support and approval  of the international community to fall back on. Without this, it would be  ridiculous to talk about it. In case Georgia gets support from international  organizations, then it may be considered as something serious.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question  from the audience: </strong>Do you agree with the opinion that conflicts are  created not by politicians but by societies with their stereotypes?<strong><br>
<br>
Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> No, I do not.<br>
<br><strong>Ragim  Aliyev, member of the panel: </strong>What can you say about trust of Georgia by Armenian  and Azerbaijani people? Because in this case the most important thing is trust&hellip; <br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> I would say that there should be a growing understanding in society  that the further away a mediator stands, the less a mediator has the ability to  handle the situation, and the more problems will emerge. A mediator should be  someone close, a neighbour, someone who understands you more than others. This  may work. Although I know, there is a sceptical attitude towards this as well. <br>
<br>
<strong>Yuri  Manvelyan, member of the panel: </strong>It was said that Georgia has its own negative  experience in conflict resolution. Can Armenia and Azerbaijan, which also have  similar negative experiences, play a mediator role in the conflict with  Abkhazia and South Ossetia?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> I would say positively that yes, Armenians and Azerbaijanis could play  a positive role in resolution of these conflicts. That is, the interaction of  our Caucasus negative experience can lead to a positive result. At least we  know what we should not do&hellip;<br>
<br>
<strong>Zaur  Dargali, member of the panel: </strong>You noted that the mediation of Georgia can be  perceived more positively in Azerbaijan. Please clarify.<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> Yes, I think so, but I will make it clear that it has not been  discussed, it is just my logical assumption. Here I proceed from the perception  of Georgia as a country having a similar problem whereas there may be a reverse  perception in Armenia.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galina  Petriashvili: </strong>I have an imaginative question. You have been dreaming about the idea of  the South Caucasus and I like it a lot. To what extent is this idea more unreal  than routine, commonplace reconciliation of Georgians and Abkhazians?<br>
<br><strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> I do not consider reconciliation with Abkhazians as a commonplace  process.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galina  Petriashvili: </strong>It means both models are similarly infeasible at the moment. United Georgia or United Caucasus - what is more feasible? <br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> In my opinion, if there could be international approval, then the role  of Georgia as a mediator is more real than Georgian-Abkhaz reconciliation. And  what is important here: Why? Abkhaz people are so Russia-centric that only when  Georgia normalizes its relations with Russia some real breakthrough may happen  between Georgians and Abkhaz. Until then, Abkhazia will perceive Georgia as an  enemy because Georgia has a problem with Russia. If Georgia and Russia will  learn how to talk to each other something will come out of Georgian-Abkhaz  dialogue as well.<br>
<br>
<strong>Malkhaz  Chemia, expert in conflicts: </strong>Do you see the economic opportunities of Georgia as a  useful resource for Georgian mediation in the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict?  Can Georgia have an interest in "forcing peace" with the help of  economic instruments. For example, by involving Armenia in regional projects,  projects of GUAM, Trans-Caucasus railway communication and other infrastructure  projects?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> The perception of a common interest, understanding of what is being  lost because of lack in cooperation - if this process happens in politics, if  we will understand what we lose and what opportunities are wasted because we  are divided in the Caucasus, this may lead to a change in our minds, in our  societies. And I can say this is what an economic instrument is all about.<br>

<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>When there is a conflict in the family, the family turns to either the  most trustworthy or the richest person which also implies some authority to  solve this conflict. If not always, this happens very often. Georgia does not  fit this mission in any perspective. Georgia itself has serious conflicts with  Abkhazia and South Ossetia and it has a negative experience of solving  conflicts. So, if Georgia will get active in mediation, there will come out of  it a legitimate argument: first settle your own mess at home, then meddle in  the business of others. I think Georgia will have an unfavourable starting  position in this regard.<br><br>

   This is very important. When this idea was initiated,  I was in Baku and asked people there about it and got similar replies. My  friends who were in Yerevan received similar feedback as well. At the public  level this idea is not accepted. What does Georgia have to do with anything if it  cannot solve its own problems especially after 2008. In this regard, the  reputation of Georgia is damaged. And this is very important. There is another  very important issue concerning Georgian citizens of Armenian and Azerbaijani  ethnicity. These people live peacefully in Georgia. What is it to live  peacefully - nowadays it is an abstract notion, but at least there is no fight,  no tension between them. I am very much afraid that the powers who do not  favour the change of the situation as a whole in the Caucasus region will set  these people against each other. I am afraid that there are very serious powers  involved in the preservation of status quo in the whole South Caucasus. These  powers are very serious and they struggle against each other, get in each  other's way. This happens in the Minsk group and other formats and not only  with the Karabakh issue but other ones too. I think it is not only the  impression that there are very serious powers in the world who favour  preservation rather than the resolution of conflicts. This is an axiom and even  a trite thing. And among these powers there is a very serious one, Russia, and  even Turkey, which sees the South Caucasus as in the realm of its influence.  Turkey made it especially clear after the August events of 2008. You all  remember Erdogan's initiative. It turns out that two big regional players, not  talking about others such as the EU, USA, are interested in the preservation of  the situation as it is and are not interested in the situation improving. By  the way, I have to say that both countries have great experience, gained over the centuries, in creating such a  situation where the people of the Caucasus are set against each other. Such a  situation is in their favour because they handled it easily in the South  Caucasus. So I think status quo is in their interest and if some third party,  say, as weak as Georgia will decide to change the situation there will be  serious problems. Problems such as setting Georgian residents of Armenian and  Azerbaijani ethnicity against each other and other problems. I will not go into  details about what Russia will do. Those who are closely engaged in the  Russian-Georgian problem know little. They think that after 2008 Russian  stopped, took positions, strengthened its military posts, built infrastructure.  Unfortunately, it is not like that. Russia now takes little steps at occupation  on the perimeter of Georgia's northern border which goes beyond the territory  of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. That is, Russia is active. And does its job. If you remember in 2009 the case with the  Mamison pass, this is a Rachin area, which was occupied by Russian border  guards and later they ousted Georgian border guards from there. This concerns  other zones neighbouring with the Kazbeghi region.
        <br>
<br>
By the way, I looked up historical examples when such a relatively weak  side tried to help a neighbour and influence the situation. From the European  space I remember the example of Sweden where it tried to stop the Soviet-  Finnish war. Sweden could not achieve anything, of course, and as a result it  ended up with expeditionary forces of different countries on its territory and  was close to being involved in a war with Russia. I repeat that Georgia will  take a serious blow from Russia in this case.<br>
<br>
And this one also. Giorgi said that Georgia does not experience friction  with Armenia or Azerbaijan on a state level. But there are some instances. For  example, with Armenia there is a tension because of the Bavr settlement. With  Azerbaijan an area of the monastery  complex of David Garedji. These issues are not on the surface, but many know  that there are many other unsolved issues concerning demarcation of the border  which could not be solved in 20 years. It means there are certain difficulties  in relations. And if Georgia were to become involved in any initiative these  problems will come to the surface in no time. We should not forget that there  are nationalist forces in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia too which are in  opposition and will immediately make use of this situation. In such a case not  only border issues will be raised. Yerevan, for example, will remember how the  rights of Armenians are violated in Georgia. Azerbaijan will remember the  violation of the rights of Azerbaijanis in Georgia. And so on. This will grow very quickly. Even if official Yerevan  and official Baku will agree to the mediation of Georgia in this issue, then  they will get such a" blow from below" that it will hurt. You know  what will start.. There will be talks that again our people are abused there,  and you invite them to solve our problems. That it, I expect an escalation of  nationalist and anti-Georgian hysteria in both countries and of course there  will be a counter-reaction in Georgia too. We have had this with Abkhazians and  South Ossetians. So this hysteria and antagonism will be directed and fuelled.  That will be for sure. Of course, we have certain political experience,  political resources, and we have gone through a lot, but I do not see that all  three of us, and Georgia in particular, have learned a lesson. We have a  situation when we don't learn each others' lessons, but also our own. Some  justify this by saying that 20 years is a short little time to gain political  maturity. But it seems to me that it is time for us to gain this political maturity and evidence for that is  2008.<br>
<br>
I have written something beforehand that was raised during questions and  in particular those asked by Malkhaz. Lets virtually suppose that Georgia has  the support of the EU and all that. The only case when Georgia can participate  in this issue will have to be through acting unusually and suggesting some unusual idea. Lets say this  idea. Georgia says it gets involved in the Karabakh conflict, primitively  speaking, and both countries [Armenia and Azerbaijan] get involved in its  conflicts - Abkhazian and South Ossetian. This is a definite proposal - you go  there, we go here. Or another idea. The Georgian representative goes to Yerevan  and says he will pass up Nabucco (which is very silly) and you will return the  occupied lands and the gas pipeline will go through your territory. Only in  this case may the position of Georgia and its willingness to mediate in the  conflict be accepted. Only in this case. You understand this is unreal. Otherwise Georgia gets  involved in a calmed down fight and with its involvement the fight starts  again. The other day I was in Baku and we met with Turkish-Cypriot and Irish  representatives. Turkish-Cypriots started to teach us all how they solve their  problems, but I do not see that they solved them all finally. But when it came  to the Irish, they were going towards their objectives step by step and reached  it and there was no player in this conflict who would get in the way. We have a  different situation.<br><br>
That is why I think if official Tbilisi states today, if there is not a  drastic decision, that it will participate in the process nothing will come of  it. <br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili</strong>: I am thankful to Mamuka for raising some very serious arguments that I  did not touch in detail because of a distribution of positions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Chairman  of the panel:</strong> It seems Mr. Khutsishvili indirectly calls on the audience to vote for  the position of Mamuka Areshidze?<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili:</strong> No, no way. I do not have  questions to the speaker, but I would like to say a couple of words regarding  what I have already said. Georgia does not have state problems with Armenia and  Azerbaijan. Of course, there is a problem of demarcation, but these are not  inter-state problems. This is another level and because of that they are easily  solved. And regarding the remark about Cypriots: of course, Turkish and Greek  Cypriots did not solve the conflict, but there is a change in the dynamics of  the situation. They solved the problem in terms of forming trade relations,  communicating with each other, establishing a simplified regime of border  movements. They have taken the economic component out of the political  conflict. If we could achieve opening borders for trade and economic relations  then this would be a good base for the political stage. Other nations cannot do  that.

<i>Chairman  of the panel announces the session of questions and answers.<br>
<br>
</i><strong>Niyazi  Mehti: </strong>You  have noted theoretically the case when there may be support from the EU for  Georgia's mediation. What does Georgia have to do to earn this support when it  is necessary. Is there now the need to change something in terms of the foreign  policy of Georgia?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>It would be good if the people of the Caucasus could solve their own  problems in their territories themselves. But it will be difficult for todays'  governments to solve them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Niyazi  Mehti: </strong>Is  the issue of Georgia's mediation and finding new dimensions of cooperation a  good reason for interaction on a state level?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>I can guess what Georgian authorities discuss with Armenia and  Azerbaijan and do not think there is need now to raise this question. I have to say that issues which are being  discussed do not contribute to the solution of many problems in the South  Caucasus. They contribute to completely different things. There are issues that  concern Russian-Georgian relations where some countries try to play a mediation  role, but there are big economic projects being discussed with Baku. In any  case, everything develops in the framework of maintaining the status quo. At  the same time, Armenia goes through hard times. It is tangible. A country  cannot develop economically while being in blockade.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zaur  Dargali: </strong>Can  EU put this mission of mediation for  Georgia on the agenda and assign Georgia with this mission?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>Even if there will be something like that, Georgia will try to sidestep  it.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zaur  Dargali</strong>:  In fact, in case of the scenario of unusual solutions, Georgia will have to  compromise its interests? For example, if Georgia suggests to exchange to its  participation in the Nabucco project.<br><br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>Georgia has to suggest such an idea to the participants of the  negotiations that would be in favour of both parties. The thing is Nabucco is a  political project aiming to maintain peace in the region and attracting  investment to the region. Earlier in the 90s when we were in touch with the  representatives from the EU, still paving their own way, they would often tell us that they are  interested in having something to do with the South Caucasus as a unified  region, as a single economic unit. They would tell us that we needed such laws,  such borders which would create opportunities for a single economic space - for  us and the EU - to maintain this region. It would be beneficial. Here I have a position "For". Besides, I play my own role too (laughter in the audience).  After all, despite Nabucco being a political project, we can compromise it in  order to create an economic space tomorrow which will be attractive for  investments.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ali  Babaev: </strong>I  agree with your arguments and want to ask this question. How do you think? Will  the situation change for the better if there is a change in the ruling regime  in Armenia since it is being governed by separatist groups which created this  conflict.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>I think answering in this case will not be appropiate. I can talk about  the Georgian government. <br>
<br>
<strong>Voskan  Sargsyan, journalist: </strong>A mediator should be honest. How can Georgia be honest  if it participates in regional projects,  oil and gas for example, and has dividends in these projects and therefore is  more or less interested in sidestepping Armenia and actually indulging the  interests of Azerbaijan? <br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>But the return of the occupied lands is in the interest of Azerbaijan as  well. If Georgia as a mediator will contribute to that this will contribute to  the interests of Azerbaijan as well. I actually moved to the position  "For" by assuming this case scenario. That Georgia will compromise  its interests and help Azerbaijan is another matter. Regarding honesty as a  mediator, I do not know any country in the world or any organization that considers  itself a mediator and and is honest. There are no honest countries in the  world.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sabina Khalilova:</strong>I  am interested in your opinion. If  Georgia will manage to talk to Russia as an equal, can Russia or third party  players allow Georgia to be a mediator?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>This is out of the question. Roughly speaking, no one will allow Georgia  "to speak up". Georgia has to work through European structures itself  in order to gain some support if Georgia wants to participate in this. And European  structures themselves have to talk Russia into this which is unlikely.  But there is another option. Armenia and Azerbaijan want Georgia to participate  and at the same time they both somehow become mediatorsin other conflicts. If there wasn't any  Armenia-Turkey protocols I wouldn't be talking about it. After the signing of  the Armenia-Turkey protocols it turned out that despite strong pressure from  many world players these two small countries took a position and both Armenia  and Azerbaijan did everything so that their interests came in the first place.  That is they ignored the positions of big players despite pressure. It means if  we really want it then it will be possible to do something about Armenia and  Azerbaijan through negotiations with them. But this is fiction and unreal for  now.<br>
<br>
<strong>Galina  Petriashvili: </strong>I have two questions: one imaginative and the other something actual. If  the meditation of Georgia may be somehow conditioned by the participation of  Armenia and Azerbaijan in the resolution of the Abkhazian and South Ossetian  conflicts, does it assume establishing a supra-national, regional initiative  which would deal with these three conflicts? Second question: what is the  purpose of Russia when it takes kilometers of land from Georgia. Why does  Russia do it?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>Regarding Russia this is a definite plan and long history but in two  words I will say that the first border of defence in case of war with NATO was  soviet-Turkey border as stipulated in the plans of soviet military HQ in  1982. After the collapse of USSR the  first border of defence disappeared, but the second border was marked along the  Caucasus mountain range, the third one - along Stavrapol of Rostov region. The  second line turned into the first one. That was 40 km along the Georgian  territory from the Caucasus mountain range, 20 km - zone of active defence, 20  km zone of passive defence. Russia started serving this border by getting hold  of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Now 40 % of that plan has been implemented by Russia.  Now Russia tries to move Georgian military servicemen on the border down below  in order to have a space of maneuver. Overall, it is a part of a big plan in  case of war with NATO and also considers construction of necessary  communications. <br>
<br>
As for the first question, I have already said that in this case there  will be more of a chance. Giorgi proved this model very well by saying that the  process may start on the grassroots level. Honestly, I am tired of attending  different conferences, listening to my Armenian and Azerbaijani colleagues  drumming the same. That is, we have  grown up in our understanding but we could not create a certain platform which  would be heard by the authorities. Such networking platforms exist, but they do  not influence the governments. Irishmen showed me a good example in this  regard.<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>I would like to add something if it is okay. There is such a notion as  the infrastructure of conflict resolution. The most effective ones in the world  turned out to be in Kenya, Ghana and Costa Rica. What does it represent? These  are reconciliation commissions which consist of the representatives of official  bodies as well as representatives of NGOs. These commissions have an official  authority confirmed by the state. Do you imagine this possibility in our  countries? I do not. But in any case there is a positive global experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question  from the audience: </strong>Your opponent said that even the departure of Russian  influence will not lead to the resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani and  Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts. What do you think in this regard? Do you not  think that the Russian presence works against the resolution of conflict?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze:</strong> The departure of Russia will certainly affect  the situation in some sense but this is a fiction. But supposing that Russia  departed and gave certain autonomy, then it will be possible with the help of  western partners to find a solution. With Abkhazians it will be easier because  they are Russia-centric, but not Russian-centric. These are different things. With Ossetians it will be harder. There is no external power  governing there. All possibilities are destroyed and now we wonder why they do  not trust us.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question  from the audience: </strong>Do you not think that the withdrawal of the Russian  base from Georgia and their billeting in Armenia, as experience shows, would become an simple method to provoke the  conflicts?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze:</strong> This weapon was not yet in demand in 2008 but  it will be needed against Georgia next time. Why? I will explain. Back in 2008 the Gyumri base was not  under the formal subordination of the HQ of the 58th army which was  set on Georgia. Now the situation has changed, now it is a southern direction.  Both the 58th and 49th armies have been recently established  in the North Caucasus, the 7th is based in Abkhazia and the 4th  in South Ossetia, and also the Gyumri base are all under the subordination of  one HQ. That is, all equipment and weapons located in the territory of the  Gyumri base and all of the people are subordinate to one HQ. In case of a new  war with Russia it will all be called out. I will not be cynical if I say that  any party tries to defend its own interests and prioritize them in this  situation. Considering this, it would be important for Georgia to remove the  bases, but where will these bases go is a second priority. There have been  similar cases in Azerbaijan and Armenia and in the whole world when your own  interests come first. Whether this will be called out in Georgia or not, in  case of a new war, definitely.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question  from the audience: </strong>So Georgia is in a win or lose situation?<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>If there is a new war it is a loss, if there is not a war it is even.<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili</strong>: I think that the withdrawal of bases from the territory of Georgia is  a natural process and it was successfully completed in May 2005. After that we  should not have ignited the situation. But we gave way and got involved in a  fight and contributed to the establishment of new bases of Russia on the territory  of Georgia. <br>
<br>
<strong>Roza  Kukhareshvili, Association of Abkhazian women: </strong>Here it was said that  Georgia cannot be a mediator in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. But I want to  ask. We have large Azerbaijani and Armenian communities. How do you imagine  their involvement in the process of resolution of Nagorno Karabakh conflict? <br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>The fact that they sit together and are involved in the issues of civil  society is a starting position. But they do not deal with conflicts. Can you  imagine Abkhazian women? We have 5,000 Abkhazians in Adjaria. Did anyone try to  talk to them during and after the war? There was a Gudaud girl who got married  in Makhindjauri and we were asked by people in Abkhazia to drive them to  Adjaria. It turned out that old people there speak the Abkhazian language  better than Gudaud Abkhazians. For them and for us it was a confession. Since  then no one made use of these people in a good sense of the word. Gold is  always on the surface and the Georgian authorities always stumble on the same  rock. They don't want to use this resource available to them and no one wants  to deal with these people.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rizvan  Guseynov, journalist: </strong>Considering that all bases and the ones located on the  territory of Georgia are under the jurisdiction of one HQ, is the military  involvement of Georgia in the Nagorno Karabakh conflict already stipulated?<strong> </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>Of course. It has been so since  the start of the conflict until now. Russia uses this conflict for its own  political purposes, keeping and maintaining the South Caucasus under its  control. By the way, 2008 was a message to the whole South Caucasus and in  particular to Azerbaijan so as to teach  them not to do something wrong again. What was important? To hold the territory  of Georgia and control the energy routes of Azerbaijan? This was the main aim.  Not South Ossetia or even Abkhazia. And look now how these military bases are  formed. Russia spends a lot of money, in Vladicaucasus, Stavropol... it is a  horrible sight to see where soldiers live, but here it is simply a European  level. They control the whole South Caucasus including Karabakh. But I have to  say that the reason why the Karabakh problem is in the air is that it is in  favour of Russia. Remember the trips of Medvedev to Yerevan and Baku. He signed  a treaty in Yerevan and then went to Baku and what did he talk and agree about  there? You know these territorial issues - with one hand Russia pampers Yerevan and with the other Baku. This way Russia  will always keep the situation under its control. My colleagues in Yerevan (and  they are very well aware of situation) told me that at least in case of a war  we cannot rely on Russia because the latter didn't sign a treaty providing for  mandatory military assistance. Probably it would be a moral support, or the  Gyumri base, but it will not be in the format which has been stipulated by the  treaty. This is what my Armenian colleagues told me. So, everything that  happens in the South Caucasus and has to do with conflict is certainly what  Russia favours and needs so that the South Caucasus is in a disconnected and  non-assembled state. And if there is no Baku oil, Russia will be happier.<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>I agree with what Mamuka has said just now and would like to add that  there is a balance in terms of soothing and escalating the tension. From the  viewpoint of the superpowers, who have powerful instruments in their hands,  there should not be too much tension. It means it is also somehow regulated. In  our particular case, there is a military base in Akhalgori which is very close  to Tbilisi and this very much affects regional security and stability in the  Caucasus. I think that Russian holds this instrument as a last weapon.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>I will only add that the first Russian outpost, the first Russian tank,  stands at a distance of 2.5 km from the Trans-Caucasian highway in the  settlement of Orchosan in the Akhalgor region. They can block the  Trans-Caucasian highway in a matter of 15 minutes.

<i>Chairman  passes the floor to the members of panel for making comments.</i><br>
<br>
<strong>Niyazi  Mehti: </strong>I  was asked in the lobby what the point of this hearing is. I think the point of  this hearing is about the debates. The similarity of ideas is obvious in ours  and your problems and we should not think that these ideas will be realized by  those sitting, say, at the Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Public power should  be involved in this. I have found new ideas for myself in this discussion and I  will try to write an article about it. Here I found a reinforcement of ideas I  have long been wanting to make customary, the idea that there is a need to  virtualize the conflicts. There is a stereotype concerning conflicts: if there  is a problem it should be completely resolved. I came to a conclusion that  there is a category of ever-being-solved conflicts. There is the mistake in  terms of Azerbaijan regarding Karabakh. There is the mistake of Armenia  regarding the Azerbaijani population. There is the mistake of Georgia regarding  Abkhazia. We have to find a method of  "ever-solution" regarding these problems. And in future we have to  work out a system of ideology of ever-being-solved problems. Thank you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ragim  Aliyev: </strong>I  want to stress the issue of nationalism and the nationalist factor. One of the  main obstacles in terms of resolution of these problems are nationalists.  Parties and movements that is, because they provoked a war and then came to  power. Now there is an idea to open a cross-border point in Nagorno Karabakh to  facilitate communication with the local population. Neither Baku nor Yerevan  agrees with this idea. This is a big misfortune for the politicians. There is  another aspect. All these conflicts are a part of the world political balance,  the political order. It is same in Palestine, it is same here. You have said a clever  thing here, Mamuka, that when people are fighting all alone face to face they  later become best friends, but when half of the world supports one side, and  the other half supports the other side, the conflict is only fuelled. We all  are hostages. I think the subject of our hearing has a common sense. There are  cultural relations, the role of the media, economic factors. For example, here  in Teqali we can create a free economic zone so that people can trade... this all  has sensible roots.<br>
<br><strong>Yuri  Manvelyan: </strong>The position "For" is closer to me, but not because I am  sitting next to Mr.Khutsishvili. Mr. Areshidze has convinced me. He was talking  about the reality and how people who have gathered here together have a minimal  impact on the situation today. Most people do not agree with this reality.  Personally I do not agree with this reality as well. I think that mediation of  Georgia in the Karabakh conflict will not cause its solution, but will more  likely be the consequence of its solution. If we suppose that it will be  possible then many issues in this conflict will be solved between Armenia and  Azerbaijan and mediation will be symbolic. Both sides will say that we decided  to make peace and you, Georgia, will play a role in making us friends. So, this  wishful position is closer to me. Lets dream so that it becomes true.<br>
<br><strong>Emil  Adelkhanov: </strong>Firstly, I want to say that this is the most interesting hearing I have  ever attended and I thank the organizers and participants for that. It was more  difficult to defend the position "For", I think. Maybe it was because  that I thought the arguments "Against" were more convincing,  unfortunately. I want to say that in my opinion Mamuka was in a more favourable  position. I was impressed by the episode from trip of David Darchiashvili to Yerevan. For those who have not heard  this story, I will tell you. So, NGOs in Yerevan are all conferencing and one  Armenian human rights activist runs in and says: "it is terrible, refugees  are called up to the army, we should protest, we should write a letter to the  president". And our David says: "I will also sign". Suddenly  Seda, I cannot remember her last name, asks: "which president will you  write a letter to? Our president?". David replies: I just thought if  I am from a neutral country..." And Seda replies to him: "what neutral  country?!" Here it is. <br>
<br><strong>Zaur  Dargali</strong>:  This event itself showed that there are real ideas which can be implemented and  I vote "For" the mediation of Georgia. Why not? Why not try? If the governments in  Armenia and Azerbaijan agree, Georgia can participate. I think Georgia may be  effective in creating civil, grassroots diplomacy. Real projects such as youth meetings can take place...<br>
<br>
<strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili (remark): </strong>There are episodic meetings happening on a grassroots  level but we have to turn it into process.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zaur  Dargali: </strong>I  think Georgia can do much to turn this into a process.<br>
<br>
<i>Chaiman  gives the floor for final word to the Speakers.<br>
<br>
</i><strong>Giorgi  Khutsishvili: </strong>The importance in assessing this idea is the following: the mediation of  the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict takes into account that Georgia is  objectively interested in an indelible Caucasus, in some processes and  developments in a common Caucasus, and in economical processes such as a common  market, common space, some interaction in decision-making. Objectively Georgia  is interested. If there is awareness in Armenia and Azerbaijan that Georgia is  interested in an indelible Caucasus then there will be a high level of trust in  Armenian and Azerbaijani societies including in the conflict zone. The trust in  Georgia's ability to play a positive role. In this case this idea can  "catapult" to Brussels and other places where European opinion is  formed and from where support for these ideas may come. There are perspectives  to work on this idea.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mamuka  Areshidze: </strong>I have been to all the hot spots of the Caucasus during war and natural  disasters. I was in Spitak in 1988, I was in Baku after January 20, and I was  in Karabakh at the time when the USSR still existed... What was interesting to me  was that In Tbilisi I met a guy who was military and in the Soviet army. You  know, maybe after April 9 almost all Georgian military servicemen left the  Soviet army, but there were single cases when some guys stayed and served. It was in the 90s if I am not mistaken  and he told me this. He was serving in the artillery unit and it turned out  that he shelled Gandja and Stepanakert... the same military unit was bombing this  and that city with intervals. I, of course, was aware of the situation overall.  But with this story I had a complete picture. It has been the same picture for  20 years. Maybe the same unit does not bomb both sides, but figuratively  speaking, the same people do the same thing... All the time everyone tries to set  Caucasus people against each other and people in the Caucasus always argue with each other. Only when we  are mature for big politics, regional politics, we will be able to start the  process of becoming closer to each other, the process of our own identity  emerging. We will do that when we will say that we will solve our own problems  (in the region), you solved your own problems (outside the region). I want to  live up to this. <br>
<br>
<i>Voting is announced</i>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Summary: </strong>28  votes for the mediation of Georgia, 9 votes against the meditation of Georgia,  2 votes neutral. <br>
<br><strong>Comment  from the audience: </strong>I voted against mediation because I do not agree with  the opinion that Georgia does not have conflicting issues with Armenia and  Azerbaijan. This is why if, at the moment, Georgia acts as a mediator it will  only ignite the situation not only in the conflict zone but also on its own  territory. It can lead to an internal conflict. <br>
<br>
<strong>Sabina  Khalilova: </strong>Until  I listened to the arguments of the speakers I thought that I would vote "for", but now I voted "against". Georgia is not ready to  be a mediator. We have to learn not to fuel additional conflicts. God forbid,  it is not very difficult to do that.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zurab  Zubashvili, Confederation "Tskhinvali home": </strong>Despite  the fact there are many objective obstacles, I voted "For". Because  we, Georgians, care about peace in the house of our neighbours.<br>
<br><strong>Sabina  Khalilova: </strong>I  want to add something. To some extent Georgia participates in the mediation  because it is a multi-ethnic country and there are some processes and dialogue  going on inside which can spread to neighbouring Armenia and Azerbaijan. But  becoming a mediator to some extent in such a complicated conflict as  Nagorno-Karabakh is impossible. 100 percent mediation is needed here and  Georgia is not capable of it.<br>
<br><strong>Leyla  Mamedova, "Azeri Youth Union of Georgia": </strong>I voted "For" and  will explain why. The arguments "For" sounded weak today, but  arguments "Against" were convincing and realistic. Nevertheless, hope  dies last and I understand that Georgia will become a mediator in this issue  not tomorrow but there is a chance. I have a small comment to that of Mr. Mehti  who said that we should move this question to the category of  "ever-being-solved". Of course, to look at it from the top virtually  and abstractly is easier and better probably. But lets not forget that this  concerns the lives of hundreds of thousands people in Georgia and millions of  people in Azerbaijan.<br>
<br><strong>Sabina  Khalilova:: </strong>If  we do whatever we want against the will of the powerful and make the mediation  of Georgia an objective we can stumble on a bomb and endanger the lives of  people.<br>
<br>
<strong>Zaur Khalilov, Civil integration foundation: </strong>I voted "For" because it is a fact that Georgia acts as a  mediator. What happens here now is already the mediation of Georgia. There are  certain processes open and hidden, political and economic, and on a grassroots level. But I would also like to say the  South Caucasus can be independent and free. Society should contribute to that as  well, and not just in the political and economic processes where there is a  position of the sides who won and lost, where there are certain manipulations.  Today society should show one thing to the authorities: its readiness to start  the process. As soon as authorities can see that people are ready to do that it  should be done genuinely for the sake of freedom and independence. I know many  people who say one thing when they meet in South Caucasian events and when they  go back to their countries they cannot repeat it and it all becomes artificial.  This should come from within. People are ready for that, but on unofficial  level. This is our problem, the problem of civil society when people cannot  speak openly and ask each other questions openly from the positions  "For" and "Against" and the need for it. This subject is  not discussed nowadays, it is taboo. In Armenia, in Azerbaijan, let alone in  Georgia. It is a very complicated issue for Georgia. I would vote  "Against" with great pleasure given the present reality. And what  happens today is very scary.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ali  Babaev: </strong>I  want to thank you for this first step. I have been involved in politics for a  long time. I myself suggested to our Armenian community here that we create a  group and address both presidents and our nations. This step forward has not been  taken since. Today as I sit with you I remember an interview with  Djigarkhanyan... These three countries have always been kindred but today society  is split. Who did this? Politicians. What? Sargsyan and Aliyev cannot sit and talk? (comment from the audience:  they have recently sat and talked). Why do they need Americans or whoever else... We ourselves can sit, talk and solve this problem. When society stands up there  is nothing politicians can do. Thank you for starting this. The truth should be  told straight to the face. As long as there is separatism and terrorism,  society will not think sensibly.<br>
<br>
<strong>Malkhaz Chemia: </strong>I want to  explain why I voted "For" not only because I am a hopeless optimist.  Caucasus is a single cultural and economic organism. Like it or not, this has  been so for centuries. Why do I still hope that this organism can be unified  and pulled together? There is a need for stability in the world. Pacts of  stability for the Caucasus have been drafted in the UN and EU, but they didn't  work. If Georgia initiates its proposal now, it will not work. But the world is  changing and there will be a time when the world will need an economically  unified Caucasus. Why was I talking about smuggling? Liquidation of  cross-border markets such as Ergnet and Sadakhlo was a big mistake. It is  impossible to prevent economic relations in the Caucasus. In a everyday life  there is no hate between us. This is the most important. This is grounds for  hope. And we simply have to be a mediator and solve all the conflicts.
